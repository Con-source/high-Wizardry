cd high-Wizardry
```

### Module Architecture

All modules follow a consistent pattern:
- **Initialization**: `init()` function called on DOM ready
- **Public API**: Exposed through module pattern
- **JSDoc Documentation**: Comprehensive type annotations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if dependencies missing

### Running in Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Multiplayer Architecture

The game uses WebSocket connections for real-time communication:

1. **Authentication**: Secure login with bcrypt password hashing
2. **Email Verification**: New accounts require email verification (configurable)
3. **Password Recovery**: Forgot password flow with email/CLI-based reset
4. **Account Security**: Ban/mute support for moderation
5. **Session Management**: Tokens with expiration and revocation support
6. **Player Sync**: Server-side player state management
7. **Location System**: Players can see others in the same location
8. **Action Validation**: Critical calculations happen server-side to prevent cheating
9. **Chat System**: Global and location-based messaging with mute enforcement

### Account Management

#### Registration
- Username (3-20 characters)
- Email (required for account recovery)
- Password (minimum 6 characters)
- Email verification sent upon registration

#### Login
- Accounts with unverified emails must verify before login (configurable)
- Banned accounts cannot log in
- Session tokens valid for 7 days

#### Password Reset
- Request reset via username or email
- Receive reset code via email or console (development)
- Reset tokens expire in 1 hour
- All sessions revoked after password reset

#### Legacy Account Support
- Accounts created before email requirement can still log in
- Prompted to add email for security
- Can add email anytime from account settings

## Save Data Migration

### v2.0 Save Format Changes

The v2.0 update adds new fields to player data:
- `consumables`: Object tracking consumable item inventory
- `guilds.memberships`: Array of joined guilds
- `guilds.reputation`: Object tracking reputation per guild
- `craftingStats.totalCrafted`: Number of items crafted
- `visitedLocations`: Array of visited location IDs
- `travelDistance`: Total kilometers traveled

**Old saves are automatically migrated** when loaded. No manual action required!

### Manual Migration (if needed)

If you experience issues with your save:

1. Export your current save:
```javascript
// In browser console:
const save = localStorage.getItem('highWizardryPlayer');
console.log(save);
// Copy the output
```

2. Clear your save:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('highWizardryPlayer');
```

3. Reload the game to start fresh, or restore with your backup.

## Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
- Email verification required for new accounts
- Password reset with time-limited tokens
- Session tokens with 7-day expiration
- Session revocation and single-session enforcement available
- Ban/mute system for moderation
- Critical game calculations (rewards, crafting) are server-side
- Input validation on both client and server
- XSS prevention in chat messages
- Rate limiting on authentication and actions
